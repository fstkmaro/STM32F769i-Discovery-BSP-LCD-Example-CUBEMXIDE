# STM32F769i-Discovery-BSP-LCD-Example-CUBEMXIDE
 An example using the stm32cubemxide to put together a project that allows the use of the built in LCD display. I have found this to be a bit confusing to many, including myself so here it is. the IOC file should be included. This example, simply writes a Hello message somewhere on the screen. I think it shows the basics and given that there is a ioc file included, one can further modify it to do more things.
